# PetStore - Console Application
This is a console application that hits the https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available swagger api to get a list of available pets, sorts these pets by category and reverse order by name and prints the output to the console. 

To run, simply build and run the PetStore project. 


# PetStoreTests - Unit tests

The unit test project was built using MSTest in .NET 5. 

There is currently one unit test - that checks that a List of Pets is sorted correctly. 

The tests can be run using Visual Studio's Test explorer.
